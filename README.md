# Two-Tier-Architecture-Using-AWS
In this project I will deploy a two tier architecture using terraform for AWS. The two tier architecture will consist of two layers; Client and Database layers. Terraform is unique in the respect of its open world and agnostic meaning multiple cloud providers can be used.
